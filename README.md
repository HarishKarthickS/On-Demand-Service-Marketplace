# ðŸš€ On-Demand Service Marketplace

## Overview
The On-Demand Service Marketplace is a cross-platform mobile application built with **Flutter** that connects users with local service providers for a variety of services such as plumbing, electrical work, cleaning, and more. Users can browse service providers, view detailed information, and book a service directly through the app. The backend API, built with **Node.js** and **Express**, handles provider data and booking requests.
